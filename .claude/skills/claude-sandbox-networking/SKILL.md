# claude-sandbox-networking

Read before designing or sketching any network-egress change. The live design
is **issue #56**; this skill is the durable context + the guards that stop
agents re-deriving already-rejected options (it has happened).

## Standing decision — the egress jail is ON by default (ADR 0015)

As of **2026-06-18** the per-process egress jail is the **default** posture
(`docs/explanations/decisions/0015-network-egress-jail.md`, **Accepted**). It is
**fail-closed**: if `/dev/net/tun` / pasta / unshare are missing, `claude`
refuses to launch (it does NOT silently fall back to open egress). The escape
hatch is `CLAUDE_SANDBOX_EGRESS_JAIL=0` (env, per session) or `egress-jail = 0`
in `/etc/claude-sandbox.conf` (per host); env wins over conf. Mechanically it's
still a layer *beneath* bwrap (a holder netns), not an in-core firewall — that
part of ADR 0005's reasoning stands.

This **overrides ADR 0005's open-egress *default*** (`0005-network-egress-open.md`,
now "Superseded in part"). 0005's analysis still applies to the `=0` path: with
the jail off the bwrap argv omits `--unshare-net` and shares the host netns, no
per-process firewall — the original open-egress behaviour. So: the default is
jailed; `=0` restores 0005's world. Don't describe egress as "open by default"
anymore, and don't re-add an "opt-in / off by default" framing — that was the
pre-2026-06-18 state.

## ALL DNS goes through pasta `--dns-forward` (issues #60, #11 — both fixed)

`jail_stage_dns()` **always** binds a `resolv.conf` naming `192.0.2.53` over
Claude's (via `CLAUDE_SANDBOX_JAIL_RESOLV`, applied in `bwrap_argv_build`),
copying the host's `search`/`domain`/`options` lines across — dropping those
breaks short-name resolution at sites with a search list. pasta attaches with
`--dns-forward 192.0.2.53` (RFC5737 TEST-NET — non-routable, outside every
blackhole), listens on that addr *inside* the netns and relays to the host's
real resolvers from the host netns. One DNS path, not two.

**`--dns-forward` is NOT side-effect-free — this is the trap.** It implies
pasta's `--dns-host` = the **first** resolver in the host's `resolv.conf`, and
pasta reverse-translates that host's port-53 replies to come from `192.0.2.53`.
Any client querying resolver #1 *directly* gets a reply from an unexpected
source, which the kernel silently discards on a connected UDP socket. So the old
"stage the forwarder only on all-loopback hosts, leave routable hosts unchanged"
design **poisoned resolver #1 on every routable-resolver host**: glibc absorbed
it as a ~10s fallback, Go clients (`glab`) failed outright, and it read as "that
DNS server is down". The only coherent choices are never enable the forwarder,
or route everything through it. We route everything through it.

Two symptoms that look like a network fault but are this: a resolver that is
`ping`-able and answers from outside the jail but times out inside, and DNS that
"works but is slow" for glibc tools while Go tools fail.

Original driver (#60): on a personal Ubuntu desktop the sole resolver is a
**loopback stub** — `127.0.0.53` (systemd-resolved) or Tailscale MagicDNS —
living in the **host** netns, answering nothing inside the jail, so every lookup
was `ECONNREFUSED` ("works at the office, fails at home"). pasta reaches it.
**Don't** "fix" stub DNS by punching loopback
`/32`s (can't route loopback) or by recovering upstreams from
`/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf` (the rejected fallback — fails for Tailscale
MagicDNS, whose `100.100.100.100` is served locally by tailscaled, not
routable). `probe-network-jail.sh` mirrors the forwarder path; this dogfood box
(`127.0.0.53` + Tailscale) is exactly the affected config.

## Diagnostic discipline — a connected UDP socket HIDES a source mismatch

When a UDP service (DNS especially) "doesn't answer" inside the jail, do not
conclude the packet was dropped until you have looked with an **unconnected**
socket. `nslookup`, `dig`, glibc, Go and a bash `/dev/udp` probe all *connect*
the socket, so the kernel discards any reply whose source differs from the
address queried — a translated reply and a lost packet are indistinguishable.
That cost real time in #11: the server was answering correctly the whole while.

Reveal it with `recvfrom` printing the peer (perl is present in the sandbox;
`dig` and `python3` are not, and `nslookup` is BusyBox — no `-vc`, and it
predates most flags you'd reach for):

```bash
perl -e 'use Socket; socket(my $s,PF_INET,SOCK_DGRAM,0);
  send($s,$Q,0,sockaddr_in(53,inet_aton($ns)));
  my $f=recv($s,my $b,512,0); my($p,$a)=sockaddr_in($f);
  print inet_ntoa($a)," ",length($b),"\n"'
```

Reply source ≠ address queried → address translation (pasta), not a firewall.
Corollary for triage: compare **all** resolvers, not just the failing one. "Only
the first one is broken" is the signature of `--dns-host`, and a single-resolver
test cannot see it.

## Runtime target — rootless Podman (NOT Docker-bridge)

v1 targets **rootless Podman** + Debian/Ubuntu + `remoteUser=root` (rootless
Docker untested). Consequences that invalidate Docker-shaped designs:
- **No host `DOCKER-USER` / iptables** knob for the unprivileged user.
- Outbound is userspace — **pasta** (modern Podman 5+ default) or legacy
  slirp4netns.
- The container likely has **no `CAP_NET_ADMIN`**.
- **Probe caps UNJAILED.** A sandboxed `claude` session reports
  `CapBnd=0000000000000000` (the shadow's `--cap-drop ALL`) and `unshare -rn`
  fails on RO `/proc/self/uid_map` — that's the *jail*, not the container. Run
  the probe from a normal devcontainer terminal.

## Rootful docker cannot host the jail (found via PR #78 CI, 2026-07)

Under **rootful docker** pasta's attach fails: `Couldn't open user namespace
/proc/<holder>/ns/user: Permission denied` — differing ns/ptrace-access
semantics vs rootless podman — so the fail-closed jail refuses to launch
`claude`. Not fixable by seccomp/apparmor-unconfined or the userns sysctl (all
were lifted when this reproduced). Consequences: rootless podman stays the
supported runtime; the published-image how-to documents the rootful-docker
caveat (escape hatch `CLAUDE_SANDBOX_EGRESS_JAIL=0`, weaker posture); and any
CI that exercises a real jailed launch must run the container under **rootless
podman** (`docker save | podman load`, then `podman run --device /dev/net/tun
--security-opt label=disable ...`) — see the e2e test in
`.github/workflows/container.yml`, which is exactly the skill's throwaway
bridge-container validation, automated. Don't burn time re-trying cap-adds on
rootful docker.

## Threat & cohorts

- **Threat = lateral movement** (issue #31, now folded into #56): a compromised
  session as a network pivot — RFC1918 probing, internal HTTP, `169.254.169.254`,
  **lab devices with default creds** (PMAC = a *safety* incident). Not exfil
  (bwrap hides creds); the asset is *network reach*.
- **Cohort A** — HTTPS to *named* hosts only. Claude Code's native sandbox
  (`allowedDomains`, an SNI proxy) fits; dual-sandbox mode is issue **#33**.
- **Cohort B (this repo's users)** — lab devices by **bare RFC1918 IP, UDP,
  dynamic ports** (EPICS CA/PVA, PMAC). A hostname allowlist **cannot express
  this**, so native `allowedDomains` is a non-fit. Needs IP/CIDR-level control.

## The approach we've landed on — issue #56 (refines #31 Option C)

Keep `--network=host` (normal shells + CA broadcast untouched); jail **only
Claude** via **Design D** (validated 2026-06-18, `probe-network-jail.sh`): the
shadow creates a user+net ns with `unshare -rn` (a *holder*); **pasta attaches
from OUTSIDE** by PID (`pasta --config-net <holder-pid>`, backgrounds); the
holder locks a **surgical routing allowlist** (see below); then
`exec bwrap … --cap-drop ALL -- claude`, which **inherits** the holder's netns
(bwrap keeps OMITTING `--unshare-net`). Ordering is load-bearing: netns → pasta →
routes locked → Claude.

**SURGICAL policy (v2 — a blanket RFC1918 blackhole is WRONG):** `pasta
--config-net` mirrors the host L3 config into the netns (address, connected
subnet, gateway, resolv.conf DNS). On an all-RFC1918 site (Diamond = all
172.23/16) a blanket blackhole kills DNS, and pasta's connected-subnet route is
more-specific than the blackhole so the whole local /20 stays reachable. So the
holder: `blackhole` 10/8 + 172.16/12 + 192.168/16 + the **connected subnet**,
`unreachable` 169.254/16; then punches back ONLY the **gateway** (/32 on-link),
the **pasta DNS forwarder** `192.0.2.53` (/32 via gw — non-routable TEST-NET,
terminates in pasta, NOT a real host), and **`allow-ip`** devices (/32 via gw).
Blackholes fail-closed; forwarder/device punches fail-soft.

**Resolvers get NO /32 — do not re-add them** (issue #11, fixed 2026-08-14).
Until then the holder punched a /32 per `/etc/resolv.conf` resolver, justified
as "resolution ≠ lateral movement". That reasoning was wrong: the punch is a
route, not a protocol filter, so it opened a real internal host on **every**
port, not just 53 — the largest remaining hole in the blackhole, aimed squarely
at infrastructure. All DNS now goes through the forwarder, so the jail needs no
route to any resolver and the holes are gone. Re-adding a resolver punch (or an
`allow-ip`-style entry for a DNS server) reopens it.

**DEAD ALTERNATIVE — do not retry:** pasta-creates-the-ns + bwrap-nested-inside.
pasta spawns a pid+mount ns it can't give bwrap a usable `/proc` for → bwrap
aborts on `/proc/<pid>` lookups; remount is EPERM (kernel proc-mount restriction).
Design D flips ns ownership (holder = user+net only → `/proc` valid).

**SECURITY rests on userns ownership + effective-cap drop.** Distinguish two cap
sets: `CapEff` (effective, active) is **0** in the jail — bwrap's `--cap-drop ALL`
empties it even in the nested userns — while `CapBnd` (the bounding *ceiling*) is
FULL (`…1ffffffffff`, a nested-userns artifact, vs 0 in the non-jail sandbox).
Route-immutability holds because the netns/routes are owned by the holder's
ANCESTOR userns (caps raised inside Claude's own userns don't reach it): verified
route del/punch + device-add all EPERM, RFC1918 stays blocked.
**verify-sandbox needs NO jail-aware variant** — check 06 asserts `CapEff=0` (not
CapBnd), which holds; the full 20-check battery passes live in a jailed session.
Cap-ceiling diligence is **VERIFIED** (`probe-network-jail-caps.sh`, unjailed,
2026-06-18): the full `CapBnd` ceiling can't be re-raised to weaken another bwrap
protection. Even with a full *effective* cap set gained via a child `unshare
-rUm` userns, remount-rw `/`, bind-over a `--ro-bind` path, and `sethostname` all
`EPERM` — bwrap's locked mounts are immutable from a descendant userns. Inert.

**Structure:** the setup is inlined as `netns_launch()` / `netns_holder()` (+ the
`egress_jail_enabled` predicate) *inside* `claude-shadow`, NOT a sourced module — preserves the single-file auditability ADR 0014 / 0008 rest
on. Revisit extraction (its own ADR) only if the net code outgrows the shadow.

**STATUS — IMPLEMENTED + END-TO-END VALIDATED (2026-06-18).** Probe + real
binary both green on a real rootless host: `CLAUDE_SANDBOX_EGRESS_JAIL=1 claude
-p` reaches the API through the jail; route-immutability battery passes; Cohort B
`allow-ip` device path confirmed reachable; same-subnet host blackholed. Lives in
`claude-shadow` (`parse_config` `egress-jail`/`allow-ip` keys, `egress_jail_enabled`
predicate + inlined `netns_holder`/`netns_launch`), **ON by default** — disable
with `CLAUDE_SANDBOX_EGRESS_JAIL=0` (env) or `egress-jail = 0` in
`/etc/claude-sandbox.conf`. Requires `/dev/net/tun` (`devcontainer.json` runArgs
`--device=/dev/net/tun`) — the one hard container-side dep; **fail-closed** if
pasta/unshare/tun missing (`claude` won't launch — the error names the `=0`
escape hatch), never a silent unjailed fallback. Interactive
`claude` + `/verify-sandbox` both confirmed live in a jailed session (18/18 pass
— check 06 asserts `CapEff=0`, which holds). Phase-2 landed on **PR #58** (refs
#56): `install.sh` installs `passt`; CapEff/CapBnd doc corrections; cap-ceiling
diligence probe written + PASSED unjailed (full `CapBnd` inert). Bridge/NAT now
**VALIDATED** (see [[network-egress-pasta-jail-wip]]): `probe-network-jail.sh`
run in a **bridge/NAT** container proves the gateway-collision + nested-pasta
paths (the RFC1918 gateway is pinned on-link before the blackhole; egress works,
RFC1918 + same-subnet still blocked). Ceiling: a bwrap *escape*
could re-plumb — a layer *beneath* the bwrap wall, never stronger. CA broadcast for Claude is gone → unicast
`EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST`.

**Network-mode-agnostic + intentional blackholing.** Design D builds Claude's
netns INSIDE the container and pasta mirrors the container's OWN connectivity, so
it works whether the container is `--network=host` OR bridge/NAT — same
requirement (`/dev/net/tun`), one install path, one error message. The jail only
RESTRICTS; it cannot grant more reach than the container already has (an
internal/isolated container can't reach a device regardless of the jail). The
`/dev/net/tun` mount and a possible `--network=host`→bridge switch are BOTH
host-`devcontainer.json` edits, so `install` must detect + error with
instructions either way. **Blackholing must be intentional** — CRITICAL in
non-host containers where the egress gateway is itself RFC1918 (or link-local
`169.254.x.x`): blackholing those ranges can sever the default route and kill ALL
egress. `netns_holder()` detects the default next-hop and pins a more-specific
route to it FIRST: **protect-gateway → blackhole-the-rest → punch allow-ip** (implemented).
PROVEN in a NON-host (bridge) container (validated 2026-06-18): (a) nested pasta
(inner pasta inside an outer-pasta'd container) works; (b) the gateway-collision
behaviour is handled (gateway pinned on-link first). To reproduce: **a bridge
container = the devcontainer with `--net=host` REMOVED**
(comment `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` runArgs line `--net=host`; KEEP
`--device=/dev/net/tun`), then rebuild and run `probe-network-jail.sh` from a
normal (unjailed) terminal — revert + rebuild afterwards (the dogfood box needs
host-net for X11 + EPICS CA). Throwaway alternative that leaves the devcontainer
alone: `podman run --rm -it --device=/dev/net/tun -v "$PWD/probe-network-jail.sh:/probe.sh:ro" <devcontainer-image> bash -lc 'apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y -qq passt bubblewrap iproute2 util-linux && bash /probe.sh'`.
EXPECT: the `[holder]` line shows an RFC1918 gateway (podman `10.88.0.1`, docker
`172.17.0.1`); `PASS internet routed via gateway` + connectivity PASS = proof
that the `$gw/32` on-link route was pinned BEFORE `blackhole 10/8` survived
egress; RFC1918 + same-subnet still blocked. The ONE code-change trigger: holder
logs `no default via/dev` → exits 4 = the dev-only-default edge (a default route
with no `via <gw>`), to be handled then. Both `--network=host` and bridge/NAT are
now validated.

## Refuse / don't re-derive

- Re-proposing the **`HTTPS_PROXY` env-var proxy** (#31 Option D) as *security* —
  a hostile process unsets it / uses a raw socket. It's a guardrail, not a boundary.
- **Docker-bridge / `DOCKER-USER` / `--cap-add NET_ADMIN`-on-the-Claude-container**
  designs — they ignore the rootless-Podman target.
- Claiming a **hostname allowlist** (native `allowedDomains`) covers **Cohort B**
  device traffic — it can't (no bare IP / CIDR / UDP).
- Reading caps **from inside the jail** and concluding the container can't do netns.
- **pasta-creates-the-namespaces with bwrap nested inside** (the dead Plan A) —
  pasta's pid+mount ns gives bwrap an unusable `/proc`; use Design D (holder owns
  a user+net-only ns, pasta attaches from outside).
- Asserting Claude is **capless in the jail** — it is NOT (`CapBnd` full, nested
  userns). Security is ancestor-userns ownership of the netns; don't "fix" the
  full caps or gate jail integrity on `CapBnd=0`.
- **Turning off `--network=host`** (per-container egress allowlist instead of
  per-process) as the DEFAULT. It IS simpler — `CapBnd=0` preserved, no
  `/dev/net/tun`, no holder/pasta-attach (root-in-container owns its own netns,
  locks routes once at init) — but it restricts the **whole** container and
  breaks EPICS CA/PVA broadcast for **all** shells, not just Claude. Rejected as
  default for this EPICS org (Design D breaks broadcast for Claude *only*). It's
  a valid **opt-in posture** for Claude-dedicated / non-EPICS containers, not a
  silent flip of the host-net default. (Keeping host-net is an EPICS-workflow
  choice, NOT a mechanism requirement — see portability note: Design D works in
  non-host containers too.)
- **Rewriting ADR 0005** to say the opposite. Its open-egress *default* is now
  overridden (jail-on-by-default), but that was recorded the right way — a
  "Superseded in part" status note on 0005 + the layered ADR 0015 — leaving 0005's
  analysis intact for the `=0` path. Record future posture changes the same way;
  don't gut 0005.
- Mounting **`docker.sock`** into the Claude container.
