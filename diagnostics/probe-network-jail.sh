# Plan B / Design D — integrated egress-jail probe (issue #56 / ADR 0015), with
# the SURGICAL routing policy (v2). Earlier versions blanket-blackholed RFC1918,
# which broke real use: pasta --config-net mirrors the host's L3 config into the
# netns (address, connected subnet, default gw), and on this site DNS resolvers
# and the gateway are themselves RFC1918 (172.23.x) — so a blanket blackhole
# kills DNS, and the mirrored connected-subnet route (more specific than the
# blackhole) leaves the whole local /20 reachable.
#
# v2 policy (validated here before patching claude-shadow):
#   - blackhole RFC1918 (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16) + the connected subnet
#   - punch back ONLY: gateway (/32 on-link), DNS resolvers from resolv.conf
#     (/32 via gw), and allow-ip devices (/32 via gw)
# => internet + DNS work; lateral movement to internal hosts (incl. same-subnet)
#    is blocked except the allow-listed devices.
#
# Stub-resolver DNS (issue #60): when /etc/resolv.conf names ONLY loopback
# resolvers (systemd-resolved 127.0.0.53, Tailscale MagicDNS) they're
# unreachable from the netns, so the probe mirrors the claude-shadow fix —
# pasta --dns-forward listens on JAIL_DNS_FWD (RFC5737 192.0.2.53) inside the
# netns and relays to the host's real resolvers, and the INNER bwrap gets a
# resolv.conf pointed at that forwarder. This box (127.0.0.53 + Tailscale) is
# exactly the affected config, so the DNS+egress test exercises the fix.
#
# Topology (unchanged from v1): parent unshare -rn holder owns a user+net-only ns
# (so /proc stays valid for nested bwrap); pasta attaches from OUTSIDE by PID;
# holder locks routes; holder execs bwrap --cap-drop ALL (NOT capless — nested
# userns — but the netns is ancestor-owned, so routes are immutable from inside).
#
# ► RUN ME UNJAILED ◄  (a normal devcontainer terminal, not a sandboxed `claude`).
#
# Usage: ./probe-network-jail.sh [DEVICE_IP[:PORT]] [HOSTNAME:PORT]
#   DEVICE_IP   optional internal device that must stay reachable via allow-ip
#   HOSTNAME    name:port for the DNS+egress test (default api.anthropic.com:443)
