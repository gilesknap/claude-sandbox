#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Bash unit test for the REVISION SELECTION in the `install` shim: which
# git ref a given invocation installs, and when it refuses to choose one.
#
# The shim defaults to the newest stable RELEASE TAG so that a first
# install (the documented clone one-liner, which lands on the default
# branch) and a later `claude-sandbox update` agree on what "current"
# means. Two properties here are load-bearing and must not regress:
#
#   1. It NEVER silently retargets a deliberate checkout. A team pins a
#      revision and bumps it as a reviewed act (ADR 0017); quietly
#      installing something newer would defeat the pin on every
#      teammate's next rebuild, with nothing in the diff to show for it.
#   2. Prereleases are excluded. "Stay current" must not hand someone a
#      beta — and a beta sorts ABOVE the release it precedes
#      (2.1.0-beta.1 > 2.0.0 by version sort), so this only holds if the
#      filter is explicit.
#
# Hermetic: builds a throwaway origin+clone with SYNTHETIC tags rather
# than testing against this repo's real history, so the expected answers
# are fixed and every tagged commit carries a STUB install.sh. Checking
# out a real tag would otherwise run that tag's REAL installer.
#
# Run via `bash tests/install_ref.sh`. Needs no root and no capabilities.
